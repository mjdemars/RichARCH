# RichARCH
RichARCH is designed to be a Simple Quick Pure path to Arch Linux with automation features.

One goal of the project to only use packages in the basic Arch Linux repos by default with the option to install a few non-standard packages (like Spotify and Pamac). Our hope is that this will help to make Arch Linux more approachable to individual and corporate users.
Make sure to backup any data you wish to keep from the storage device you plan to use with the RichARCH installer.
