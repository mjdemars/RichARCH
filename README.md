# RichARCH
Creating a Rich experience to Arch.

RichARCH is designed to be a Simple Quick Pure path to Arch Linux including kickstart like automation features and Hyprland ricing options.

One goal of the project is to only use packages in the basic Arch Linux repos by default with the option to install some non-standard packages. Our hope is that this will help to make Arch Linux more approachable to individual and corporate users.
